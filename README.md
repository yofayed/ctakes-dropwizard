# ctakes-dropwizard

This project serves annotations generated by Apache cTakes using a Dropwizard server. 

## To use the service

```POST localhost:8080/annotate```

```HEADERS: Content-type: application/json```


```{ "text": "The patient was diagnosed with the flu"}```

## To start the server:

* sh setup.sh
* ```java -Dctakes.umlsuser=<umls_username> -Dctakes.umlspw=<umls_passwd> -jar target/ctakes-dropwizard.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar server```


## To run the server in an IDE:

* For Eclipse: add the resources folder as a class folder to the build path
* For Intellij: add the resources folder to the classpath

and edit the run configurations for app.App by setting the VM arguments (umlsuser and umlspw) and program arguments (server).
